Fetch Test Notes
================
To test code, use simulated.microscope file and tile small surface and mark as safe, and mark some internal area as explorable.

1. File Numbering:         To enusre file numbering increases from one session to another, start an auto tile run and collect images.
	                   Stop it part way and close the session. Open another session and make sure FileSeries has incremented.
	                   Start run, and set Time/Date on computer so that it is a different day to make sure FileSeries resets to zero.

2. Auto Tiling At Fixed z: To test auto tiling at fixed z, start an auto tile run until images begin to be collected.
			   Stop run and check box "Skip Surface Find On Image Resume." Click run, and imaging should resume immediately.
			   Repeat, but now uncheck the box "Skip Surface Find on Image Resume." Click run, and surface find should begin/complete, followed by imaging.
			   .acquisition files should have the checked status of the checkbox once the state has been changed (by default, it is set to unchecked).
